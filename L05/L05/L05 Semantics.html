                            Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of time.<br>

                            Unlike humans, dogs don’t have the ability to create actual measures of time,<br>

                            like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t know how to read clocks.<br>

                            So, telling them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much, but we understand<br>

                            that you feel like you have to do it anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained based on<br>

                            past events, and can be taught to anticipate future events based on past experiences.<br>

                            Pavlov’s dogs are the perfect example of this.<br>

                            The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog,<br>

                            it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the modern wolf is the dog's<br>

                            nearest living relative. Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by<br>

                            hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture.<br>
