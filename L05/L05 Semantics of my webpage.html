                            <h2> Deforestation</h2>
                                <p>
                                        deforestation, the clearing or thinning of forests by humans.<br>
                                         Deforestation represents one of the largest issues in global land use.<br>
                                         Estimates of deforestation traditionally are based on the area of forest<br>
                                        cleared for human use, including removal of the trees for wood products<br>
                                         and for croplands and grazing lands. In the practice of clear-cutting,<br>
                                         all the trees are removed from the land, which completely destroys the forest.<br>
                                          In some cases, however, even partial logging and accidental fires thin out the <br>
                                           trees enough to change the forest structure dramatically.

                                    The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that<br>
                                    the annual rate of deforestation is about 1.3 million square km per decade,<br>
                                    though the rate has slowed in some places in the early 21st century as a <br>
                                    result of enhanced forest management practices and the establishment of nature<br>
                                    preserves. The greatest deforestation is occurring in the tropics, where a <br>
                                    wide variety of forests exists. They range from rainforests that are hot and<br>
                                    wet year-round to forests that are merely humid and moist, to those in which <br>
                                    trees in varying proportions lose their leaves in the dry season, and to dry open<br>
                                    woodlands. Because boundaries between these categories are inevitably arbitrary, <br>
                                    estimates differ regarding how much deforestation has occurred in the tropics.

                                    <h3>Effects on climate change</h3>
                                     <p>
                                        The scientific consensus on deforestation is that it intensifies climate change<br>
                                         at a dramatic rate, making protecting tropical rainforests an essential part of <br>
                                         achieving the climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement.
                                         Trees are known for their<br>
                                       capacity to absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. Healthy forests act as extremely <br>
                                       valuable carbon sinks, absorbing an estimated 16 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide <br>
                                       per year, and currently holding 861 gigatonnes of carbon in their branches, leaves, roots,<br>
                                        and soils.
                                     Deforestation is turning these sinks into huge net emitters, threatening global<br>
                                      climate action and contributing to a steep rise in global temperatures. The current<br>
                                       rate of rainforest-loss generated emissions is nearly 25% higher than those generated<br>
                                        in the European Union and just slightly below US levels.
                                      Deforestation also increases the risk of <br>
                                      uncontrollable wildfires because of humans burning vegetation. This, in turn,<br>
                                       contributes to destroying forests, further intensifying the loss of forests.

                                <p>
                                    In addition to their role as carbon sinks, forests are a crucial component of the water cycle<br>
                                    and have the all important function of preventing desertification. Cutting down trees can disrupt<br>
                                     he cycle by decreasing precipitation and affecting river flow and water volume. In the case of <br>
                                    the Amazon rainforest, research shows that at least 80% of its trees would be needed in order to <br>
                                    keep the hydrological cycle going. With nearly 17% of the forest lost already, the Amazon is <br>
                                    currently at its tipping point. Statistics show that deforestation in the tropics reduces precipitation <br>
                                    over the Amazon by around 10%, or 138 millimeter, every year. In the South Asian Monsoon region, the <br>
                                    reduction in rainfall is even higher, with around 18% less rain recorded in India in a single year.Aside<br>
                                    from their contribution to the water flow, trees help the land retain water and sustain forest life by <br>
                                    supplying the soil with rich nutrients. Deforestation deprives the land of its cover, leaving the soil <br>
                                    exposed to wind and rain. This makes soil vulnerable to being washed away, and prone to erosion. According<br>
                                    to the World Wildlife Fund, as much as half of the world’s topsoil has been lost as a consequence of the <br>
                                    nearly 4 million square miles of forest that have been lost since the beginning of the 20th century.
