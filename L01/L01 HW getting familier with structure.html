        <h2>
        Hi my name is Sreenandan and i am from India.<br>
        I am studying in Alkhor International School.<br>
        As a Student of Alkhor International School i will do my responsibilites<br>
    in the way that my teachers want me to do.
    Not any bad behaviour of any kind is tolerated in this school.<br>
    This makes the students in the school to follow the guidelines of the school<br>
    and make sure they behave properly in the school building.<br><br>

    In my personal life i have nothing much to say<br>
    my hobbies are to just play outside with my friends <br>
    and play video games with them.<br>
    Even though my friends call me a "NERD" i still take the name<br>
    "NERD" in a good way. As "NERD"s are people who studies<br>
    better than most of the students.<br><br>

    
    this is all about me 
    </h2>
